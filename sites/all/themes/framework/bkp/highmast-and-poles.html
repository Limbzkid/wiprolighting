              <h1>HighMast <span class="semiBold">and Poles </span> </h1>
              <p>High Mast lighting is currently the most efficient and cost effective way of illuminating large outdoor areas such as highways, railway yards, dock yards, parking lots, shopping centers, power plants, coal mines, warehouses, toll plazas and road junctions. </p>
              <p>High Masts can be mounted at considerable heights, thus rendering uniform illumination to the entire area. It also enables easier installation and maintenance of luminaires due to motorized controls that lowers and raises the luminaires. The sleek high masts lighting is also aesthetically superior to the conventional lattice structures or lower height poles. </p>
              <p>Wipro Lighting offers comprehensive range of solutions in High Masts. The range is available in standard heights,12/16/20/25/30 metres. All these options support various luminaire combinations depending on lighting design requirements. </p>

              <p>The assembly is housed in a chassis and is secured axially. The pulley is made of non corrosive material and runs on self-lubricating bearings with stainless steel spindles. This complete assembly is hot dip galvanized.</p>

            <h2>Wintches<span class="semiBold"></span></h2>
              <p>The double drum winch driven by a single speed reversible power tool is a self sustaining mechanism which does not get affected by weather or moisture. It is designed as a self lubricating winch by using oil bath. </p>
               <h2>Lantern <span class="semiBold">Carriages</span></h2>
              <p>The lantern carriage is made of durable steel tube and serves the dual purpose of carrying luminaires as well as acts as an electrical conduit. It is provided with rubber gaskets internally which allows easy movement and avoids scratches on the Mast surfaceâ€¨during movement. </p>
              
               <h2>Accessories<span class="semiBold"></span></h2>
              <p>Flexible marine grade stainless steel wire ropes (AISI SS316) are used in 7/19 construction in the Mast assembly. Accessories like trailing cable, cable connections, lightning arrester, power tool, feeder pillar box and aviation obstruction luminaire are provided with the Mast.
